tests.integration.test_stream_oversized_line_zip
================================================

Integration tests for oversized-line handling in streamed ZIP members.

Overview
--------
This module verifies the package's bounded-memory behavior when streaming
archive members that contain extremely long logical lines without newline
delimiters.

This is one of the most important end-to-end guarantees in the library.
The public streaming contract promises that internal buffering remains
bounded and that oversized unterminated content is force-flushed as a
decoded chunk once the configured byte threshold is exceeded.

Behavior under test
-------------------
The integration cases ensure that the package:

- force-flushes oversized unterminated buffers through the public API
- continues streaming remaining content after a forced flush
- does not require newline delimiters to make forward progress
- preserves final partial content after one or more forced flushes
- does not strip a trailing carriage return during forced oversized flush

Test philosophy
---------------
These are true integration tests. They exercise the full runtime path
using real ZIP archives and the public ``LineStreamer`` API rather than
testing only the lower-level buffered reader in isolation.
