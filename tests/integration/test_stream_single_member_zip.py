tests.integration.test_stream_single_member_zip
===============================================

Integration tests for basic end-to-end ZIP member streaming.

Overview
--------
This module verifies the primary happy-path behavior of the package:
streaming decoded text lines from a single file stored inside a ZIP
archive.

Unlike the unit tests, these checks exercise the full runtime pipeline:

- archive path normalization and validation
- ZIP archive opening
- target member resolution
- buffered binary reads
- byte-to-text decoding
- line emission through the public ``LineStreamer`` API

Behavior under test
-------------------
The integration cases in this module ensure that the library can:

- stream lines from a ZIP containing exactly one matching member
- resolve a nested member by basename using the default resolver
- preserve line ordering across the full end-to-end pipeline
- emit the final partial line when the file does not end with a newline

Test philosophy
---------------
These are true integration tests. They use real temporary ZIP archives
and validate the full public streaming flow rather than isolated helper
functions.
