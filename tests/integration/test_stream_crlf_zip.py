tests.integration.test_stream_crlf_zip
======================================

Integration tests for CRLF line-ending handling in streamed ZIP members.

Overview
--------
This module verifies that the full streaming pipeline correctly handles
files that use Windows-style CRLF line endings (``\\r\\n``).

Although CRLF normalization is implemented in the lower-level streaming
components, these tests ensure that the behavior remains correct when
executed through the public ``LineStreamer`` API against real ZIP
archives.

Behavior under test
-------------------
The integration cases ensure that the package:

- strips the trailing ``\\r`` when lines end with ``\\r\\n``
- emits decoded lines without newline characters
- preserves correct behavior across chunk boundaries
- handles a final CRLF-terminated line correctly

Test philosophy
---------------
These tests validate the behavior of CRLF normalization across the
complete runtime pipeline rather than testing the helper functions
directly.
