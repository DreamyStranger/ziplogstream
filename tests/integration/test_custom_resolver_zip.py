tests.integration.test_custom_resolver_zip
==========================================

Integration tests for custom ZIP member resolution.

Overview
--------
This module verifies that caller-provided resolver functions integrate
correctly with the public ``LineStreamer`` API when streaming real ZIP
archives.

The custom resolver hook is the primary extension point of the library.
These tests ensure that custom selection logic is honored end to end and
that resolver-level failures propagate through the public streaming
surface unchanged.

Behavior under test
-------------------
The integration cases ensure that the package:

- uses the caller-provided resolver instead of the default resolver
- streams the member selected by custom resolution logic
- allows custom resolvers to ignore the original target if desired
- propagates custom resolver failures through the public API

Test philosophy
---------------
These are true integration tests. They exercise the full runtime path
using real ZIP archives and the public ``LineStreamer`` API, while
swapping out only the member resolution policy.
