tests.unit.archive.test_validators
==========================

Unit tests for :mod:`zipstreamer.archive.validators`.

Overview
--------
This module verifies the behavior of the archive path validation helpers
used by the high-level streaming API.

The validator layer is intentionally small, but it is important because it
forms the first line of defense against invalid user input. These tests
ensure that path normalization and validation remain explicit, predictable,
and package-specific.

Behavior under test
-------------------
The validator helpers are expected to:

- normalize supported path inputs into ``pathlib.Path`` objects
- reject unsupported input types
- reject empty string paths
- raise ``FileNotFoundError`` for missing archive paths
- raise ``ZipValidationError`` for non-file paths
- raise ``ZipValidationError`` for non-``.zip`` suffixes
- accept existing ZIP files

Test philosophy
---------------
These are focused unit tests. They validate only path normalization and
path-level archive checks. They do not test ZIP member resolution or the
streaming pipeline.
