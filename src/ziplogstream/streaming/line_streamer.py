ziplogstream.streaming.line_streamer
===================================

High-level ZIP member line streaming interface.

Overview
--------
This module provides the public `LineStreamer` class, which streams
decoded text lines from a target file stored inside a ZIP archive.

The class is intentionally thin and orchestration-focused. It delegates:
- path normalization and validation to `ziplogstream.archive.validators`
- member selection to a resolver
- chunked binary line reading to `BufferedLineReader`

Public contract
---------------
- The target member is streamed directly from the ZIP archive.
- The member is never extracted to disk.
- Decoded lines are yielded one at a time without a trailing newline.
- Memory use remains bounded by chunked reads and forced buffer flushes.

Design goals
------------
- Small and predictable public API
- Clear separation between archive concerns and streaming concerns
- Support for custom member resolution strategies
- Bounded-memory operation for very large inputs

    Stream decoded text lines from a file inside a ZIP archive.

    Args:
        zip_path:
            Path to the ZIP archive.

        target:
            Filename or suffix identifying the desired member inside
            the archive.

        config:
            Optional streaming configuration. If omitted, defaults from
            `LineStreamerConfig` are used.

        resolver:
            Optional ZIP member resolver. If omitted, the package default
            deterministic resolver is used.

    Notes
    -----
    `LineStreamer` is the main public entry point for the library. It
    focuses on orchestration and delegates low-level buffered line reading
    to `BufferedLineReader`.
