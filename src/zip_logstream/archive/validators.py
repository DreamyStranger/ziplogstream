zip_logstream.archive.validators
==============================

Validation helpers for ZIP archive inputs.

Overview
--------
This module contains validation logic for archive-related inputs used by
the zip-logstream package. Its purpose is to keep path and archive checks
separate from streaming and member resolution logic.

Design goals
------------
- Fail early on invalid archive inputs
- Keep validation rules explicit and testable
- Raise package-specific exceptions where possible
- Avoid mixing validation with I/O-heavy streaming code

Current scope
-------------
This module validates:
- archive path existence
- archive path type

Notes
-----
Validation in this module is intentionally lightweight. It does not fully
parse or inspect the archive contents. It only verifies that the provided
input is suitable to attempt ZIP access.
