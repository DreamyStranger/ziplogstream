zip_logstream
===========

Streaming UTF-8 and text lines directly from files inside ZIP archives.

Overview
--------
`zip_logstream` is a focused library for bounded-memory, streaming reads of
text files stored inside ZIP archives. It is designed for large log-like
inputs where full extraction is undesirable and a single-pass iteration
model is preferred.

Public API
----------
The package exposes:
- `LineStreamer` as the primary high-level entry point
- `LineStreamerConfig` for streaming configuration
- `default_zip_member_resolver` for deterministic member selection
- package-specific exception types for explicit error handling
